   - Number cards: Face value (2-10).  
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10 points.  
   - Ace: 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player.

2. **Objective**  
   - Get a hand total closer to **21** than the dealer without exceeding **21**.

3. **Initial Deal**  
   - Players and the dealer are dealt **two cards** each.  
   - One of the dealer's cards is **face up**, and the other is **face down**.

   - Must hit until reaching at least **17**.  
   - Must stand on **17** or higher.

6. **Winning Conditions**  
   - Player wins if their hand is closer to **21** than the dealerâ€™s.  
   - Player loses if their hand exceeds **21** (bust).  
   - If both have the same total, it's a **tie** (push).

7. **Blackjack**  
   - An initial hand of an Ace and a 10-point card is a **Blackjack** and wins automatically unless the dealer also has a Blackjack.

8. **Busting**  
   - Exceeding **21** results in an automatic loss.

   - If both player and dealer have the same hand total, the bet is returned to the player.

    - After the initial deal, a player can double their bet, receive **one additional card**, and then must stand.

11. **Split**  
    - If dealt two cards of the same rank, the player may split them into two separate hands, placing an additional bet.

12. **Insurance**  
    - If the dealerâ€™s face-up card is an Ace, players can take insurance (half of their initial bet) against the dealer having a Blackjack.
